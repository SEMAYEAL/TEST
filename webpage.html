We have started our first Institution named “INSTITUTE OF GENETIC ENGINEERING” introduced B.Sc Hons in Biotechnology, Microbiology, Genetics and Molecular Biology along with PG course (M.Sc in Genetic Engineering) under affiliation of West Bengal University of Technology.</BR>
Our Trustees have decided to set up another center to promote Human Genetics and its clinical applications entitled “INSTITUTE OF GENETIC MEDICINE AND GENOMIC SCIENCE (IGMGS) and affiliated to West Bengal University of Health Sciences (WBUHS) to run paramedical courses from current academic year ( 2009-10).<br>
