<h3>Our Infrastructure...</h3>
<u>Facilities and Equipment</u>

With the advent of the new Institute, emphasis was made to equip laboratories as per subjects demand and recommended by reputed Universities. Our Courses were designed as per International Universities curriculum so that our student could compete higher education in foreign universities to the same courses.<br>

Our Institute has basic infrastructure as per subjects and University has affiliated for the same courses. It has also advanced laboratory in following areas to do PG and Ph.D program - facilities like<br>

Experimental Laboratory in Human Molecular Genetics and Molecular Cytogenetics; for Molecular Cytogenetics (FISH / CGH by Chromsome Analyzer- Oympus,Japan) studies along with complete animal cell culture laboratory (CO2 Incubator & Ultra Freezer; Forma;USA) ; and Molecular Genetics (DNA Analysis / PCR / RT-PCR ).<br>

Experimental Laboratoryr for Model Organism ( As recommended by Human Genome Project) for PG studies ; Facilities available for Human Disease Genes Searching and Expression in selected model organism are – Human/ Mice / Zebra Fish / Drosophila.<br>

Experimental Laboratory in Tissue Culture and Transgenic application; Human, Animal and Plant Cell Culture and Genome Variation studies by Genomic Markers and DNA Profiling )
Experimental laboratory in Bioinformatics along with e-Library facilities for PG courses : Medical Informatics<br>
