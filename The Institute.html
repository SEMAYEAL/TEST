Biotech Foundation (a non-profit making Trust) was formed in the year 2003 for promoting education, training and research in Genetics and Biotechnology in West Bengal. We have started our first Institution named “INSTITUTE OF GENETIC ENGINEERING” introduced B.Sc Hons in Biotechnology, Microbiology, Genetics and Molecular Biology along with PG course (M.Sc in Genetic Engineering) under affiliation of West Bengal University of Technology. We have complete infrastructure (Advanced laboratories, Digital Library with Broad band Internet facilities and Auditorium) along with qualified faculties (see www.ige-india.com) to run the same courses. Already four batches of under graduate and two batches of post graduate are passed out with flying coloors and successfully enter to various professional courses in India and Abroad.
</br>
Our Trustees have decided to set up another center to promote Human Genetics and its clinical applications entitled “INSTITUTE OF GENETIC MEDICINE AND GENOMIC SCIENCE (IGMGS) and affiliated to West Bengal University of Health Sciences (WBUHS) to run paramedical courses from current academic year ( 2009-10);
